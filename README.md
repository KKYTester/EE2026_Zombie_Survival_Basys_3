# EE2026_Zombie_Survival_Basys_3

## Set up the Vivado project

The Vivado project is generated locally using `create_project.tcl`. The repository
contains the HDL sources and constraints; generated project and build files are
ignored by Git.

### Prerequisites

- Install Vivado with support for Artix-7 devices. The current local setup uses
  Vivado 2025.2.
- Clone or download this repository, keeping `create_project.tcl` and
  `FDP2026.srcs/` together in the repository root.

### Create the project in Vivado

1. Open Vivado with no project open.
2. Open the **Tcl Console** at the bottom of the window. If it is hidden, select
   **Window > Tcl Console**.
3. Run the following command, replacing the example path with the full path to
   your copy of `create_project.tcl`:

   ```tcl
   source {C:/path/to/EE2026_Zombie_Survival_Basys_3/create_project.tcl}
   ```

   On Windows, use forward slashes (`/`) and keep the braces so paths containing
   spaces work. The script resolves all project files relative to itself, so you
   do not need to change Vivado's working directory.

4. Wait for the script to finish. It creates and opens the `FDP2026` project at
   `build/FDP2026/FDP2026.xpr` with:
   - FPGA part: `xc7a35tcpg236-1` (Basys 3).
   - Top module: `My_Top_Module`.
   - Sources: all `.v`, `.sv`, `.vhd`, `.vhdl`, `.vh`, and `.svh` files under
     `FDP2026.srcs/sources_1/new/`, including subfolders.
   - Constraints: `Basys3_Master.xdc`.

### Reopen or regenerate the project

For later sessions, open `build/FDP2026/FDP2026.xpr` directly in Vivado; you do
not need to run the script again. The script sets up the project only; run
synthesis, implementation, and bitstream generation from Vivado when needed.

If you need to regenerate the project, close it in Vivado first, preserve any
needed build results, then delete only the generated `build/FDP2026/` folder and
run the script again. The script does not overwrite an existing project.

Edit and commit the HDL and constraint files under `FDP2026.srcs/`. Put new HDL
source files under `FDP2026.srcs/sources_1/new/` (or its subfolders). The script
discovers them each time it creates a project, so you do not need to edit the
script when adding or removing HDL files.

An already-open project does not automatically refresh when files appear on disk.
Use Vivado's **Add Sources** to add new files to your existing project, or
regenerate the project using the steps above. Keep simulation-only testbenches
outside this design-source folder.
